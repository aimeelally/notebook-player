    "# Introduction to Numpy and Pandas\n",
    "Numpy is a Python library for performing mathematical operations on arrays and matrices. The Pandas library in Python allows for data manipulation and analysis. It offers data structures and operations for manipulating numerical tables and time series. At the core of the pandas data model is the pandas series that, in turn, is built on the numpy array.\n",
