    "\n",
    "Supervised learning can be broadly classified into regression or classification problems. Regression models the relationship between a continuous target variable (often denoted as 𝑌) and a set of independent variables (often denoted as 𝐗), while classification models apply when the target variable is binary.\n",
    "\n",
    "Summary:\n",
    "The aim of regression is to find the mathematical relationship between a dependent and one or more independent variables. When the target variable is binary, we use classification models, such as classification trees and logistic regression."
